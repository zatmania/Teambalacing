I've made the following changes to accommodate grades between 1 and 30000:

Updated the grade input validation to accept values from 1 to 30000
Added number formatting to display large numbers with commas for better readability
Adjusted the input field width to accommodate larger numbers
Kept the same balancing algorithm which works equally well with larger numbers
The application works the same way:

Enter player names and grades (1-30000)
Add all 10 players
Click "Balance Teams" to create two balanced teams
Use "Reset" to start over
The teams will be balanced based on the total grade sum while maintaining even distribution of skill levels.
